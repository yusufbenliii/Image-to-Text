Our technical world is becoming more complex
while our need to communicate effectively with a
wider variety of people is increasing. The new
millennium requires technical professionals who can
communicate effectively and skillfully in a varicty of
situations and with people with diverse cultural and
professional backgrounds and abilities. This is our
present requirement and our future need.

However, the typical engineering graduate has
spent 4 to 5 years studying physics, dynamics,
chemistry, electronics, and engineering in an attempt
to prepare for a productive career in the field of
engineering and often not even one class has been
devoted to human communication processes. The
engineering disciplines require a certain mode of
thinking. The analytical processes required to
succeed as an engineer do not automatically lend
themselves to effective human communication. Very
few engineering students have the insight to enroll in
communication classes. Very few engineers even
believe that communication is an issue for them until
they are in the work environment and are faced with
what seems to be an inability to connect with
influence people. For the typical engineering student,
effective communication skills are assumed to come
along as a process of human maturation.

What would be the benefit if communication
tools and techniques were taught to engineers?
Imagine engineering graduates who could effectively
convey their ideas and concepts and values to a wide
variety of colleagues and customers. This would be a
boon to the engineering and business communities.
Specific communication tools and techniques exist to
help technical professional achieve this outcome.
When these techniques are applied, effective
communication is all but guaranteed.
